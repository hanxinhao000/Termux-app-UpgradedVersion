To keep the distro small and light weight for easy install, most distro except Arch Linux and Kali Nethunter are minimal rootfs, which means most package are not installed yet, you could install them according to your need, and stop asking if the distro is faked.\n\n2. All distro are installed in this directory: /data/data/com.termux/files/home , please make sure that you have enough space before installing package and don\'t blame the app for occupying your device space because you are the one controlling it.\n\n3. Some distro may not available due to your device architecture.\n\n4. Currently, all device except mips based will work, if you encountered any error such as Proot signal 6, or function not implemented, just go to the Patches feature in app and apply SECCOMP path.\n\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day :)</string>
